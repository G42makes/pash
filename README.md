# Pash - Python Bash Shell Implementation

A powerful, cross-platform shell that combines the flexibility of Python with the familiarity of Bash/Sh.

## Overview

Pash is a Python implementation of the bash shell that supports three modes of operation:

- **sh mode**: A basic shell with minimal POSIX-compliant features

- **pash mode**: Extended bash mode with Python integration

## Installation

sh    # sh mode
```
