# AI Usage in Pash

This document describes how artificial intelligence tools have been used in the development of Pash and our policies regarding AI-assisted contributions.

## AI Tools Used

Portions of Pash's codebase were developed with assistance from:

- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - Used for initial project structure, code generation, and documentation

## AI Contribution Policy

We welcome contributions that have been developed with AI assistance, but we request transparency about such assistance. When submitting code that was significantly generated or influenced by AI tools:

1. **Disclose AI usage** in your pull request description
2. **Explain your process** - how you used AI, what prompts you used, and how much you modified the output
3. **Review AI-generated code carefully** before submitting to ensure it's secure, efficient, and appropriate

## Our AI Process

For code generated with AI assistance in the core project:

1. All AI-generated code is thoroughly reviewed by human developers.
2. Tests are written to verify the correctness of the implementation.
3. Code is refined based on practical use and user feedback.

## Benefits and Limitations

AI assistance helps us:
- Accelerate initial development
- Generate documentation
- Explore alternative implementations

However, we recognize that AI-generated code may:
- Contain subtle bugs or security issues
- Not always follow best practices
- Miss important edge cases

Our human review process is designed to mitigate these limitations.

## Attribution

We believe in transparency about AI usage while recognizing that human developers are ultimately responsible for the code in this project. The primary authors of this project are the human contributors who guide, review, and refine the development process.
